  <h3>What is MERN Stack?</h3>
  <pre><p>
 MERN Stack: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web
 applications. 
 MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to
 make the development process smoother and easier.
 Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of
 these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

   <h2>Components of MERN: </h2>
   <hr>
   1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database 
      MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are 
      similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its
      users to create schema, databases, tables, etc.
   2. Express: Back-End Framework: Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using 
      Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end 
      code.
   3. React: Front-End Library React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. 
      React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its 
      ability to handle rapidly changing data. 
   4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run 
      their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose 
      from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download.
